# react-route-skeleton
reactjs skeleton with react-router, gulp and browserify

1. you'll need node to set up the project

2. once you have node, cd to project root and execute npm install

3. 'gulp build' will build the app in 'dist/' and will automatically watch for changes
you'll need to set up a server and open '/dist/index.html'

you'll also need <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en" target="_blanl">livereload extension</a> in order to livereload the app on change 

You can see further developed project with Premier League Results <a href="https://github.com/bobbykolev/react-results-app">here</a>
